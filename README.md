## Description

This is a full-stack application that allows users to view other's blogposts as well as edit, create, and delete blog posts specific to them. It uses the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session npm package for authentication.
